-- Download Windows driver from
	* https://www.minidsp.com/userdownloads/usb-mic-array-series/uma-8-drivers

-- After installing the driver microphone will be shown as "miniDSP micArray XVSM"

-- Need to configure UMA-8-SP for 7 channel configuration 
	* Burn the raw channel firmware
		-- Connect both USB and power cable to miniDSP
		-- Run miniDSP UAC2 DFU Tool
		-- Browse to the firmware: UMA8SP\exec\micArray_VF_v1.4\micArray_vf_raw_v1.3_up.bin (for raw channel outputs)
		-- Start burning, once it shows "Successful", Exit the DFU tool

	* Verify the device can collect 8 channel measurements now
		-- Open miniDSP UAC2 Control Panel
		-- Under Format tab, the input should show 8 channels, 24 bits

-- Ensure that "Speakers (miniDSP mic-Array Multi-channels)" and "miniDSP micArray Multi-channels" are selected and unmuted


-- TODO

	* Add birdsound at the beginning to ensure speaker-microphone works before proceeding -- DONE

	* prepare a README

	* figure out the location of microphone 0, 1, 2, in the audioData array and update figure: Best guess, audioData(:, 1) is Mic0, and so -- DONE

	* identify the dB of the speaker and update README

	* implement FMCW recovery technique on the received signal

	* implement breathing and HR detection technique on the recovered signal

	create README for better code readability

	integrate smartwatch with FMCW breathing
	Add README for data collection 

-- Simultenous speaker-microphone operations requires parallel computing toolbox
	* Install the parallel computing toolbox from Add-Ons --> Get Add-Ons
	* Validate paralllel pool in MATLAB
	* Open Cluster Profile Manager
	* Select 'Processes (default)'
	* Press Validate and ensure it passes all checks

-- Debug, why correlation output is showing negative values in the lab --
