# Sitting Posture Detection Using Audio Signals

This project estimates sitting posture using **audio wave reflections (FMCW signals)** from a laptopâ€™s speaker and microphone. Unlike camera-based posture detection, this approach preserves 
**privacy** and requires **no additional hardware**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **Matlab** for signal processing & posture detection.
- Employs **FMCW signals** to classify different sitting postures.
- Implements **K-Means clustering & PCA** for classification.
